Today we’re going to talk about technology and the medical field(醫學領域).

The video called “Is this the future of help”. You probably won’t get any clue(得不到任何頭緒） just from the title but the concept of the video is very interesting.

I think this points out a really good question(點出了非常好的問題）. You see in the modern day, hospital doctors or data processing is efficient enough. I’m not a doctor, I’ll never sure what’s going on but it’s that the doctors are not spending enough time with their parents(醫生沒花足夠時間在病患身上）. They should be able to spend more time with them to better understand the symptoms.

But right now, I think the doctors are spending more hours daily just on processing these data and we know that each person only has 24 hours of a day and we probably work for 8 hours of a day and the doctors are spending so much time on the data. How are they going to focus on their patients?

This will help the technology steps in(介入）. We know the machines, they don’t really need to sleep like humans need a rest. So they can work 24 hours nonstop (不休地）and that’s why it can improve the hours that the doctors can spend on their patients(有助醫生照顧病患的時數）.

Anyway, it’s quite impressive(令人欽佩的）, it’s quite amazing. Make sure you go check out the video and let’s move on to today’s lesson.
