First of all, I would like to say Happy Mother’s Day to all of the mamas around the world.

Your mamas are the greatest, strongest and warmest human beings there.

They go through almost 10 months of pregnancy and just make one baby and that’s you.

During the pregnancy, there could be sickness and some other uncomfortable problems. They might come along (uncertain)too.

*come along 出現；抵達；進展

*You can go to the restaurant now and I’ll come along later（我等會過去） .

*How’s your graduation project coming along(進展）?

Also on this day, we should give credits (功勞）to all the signal mamas and dads out there.

Some of you had to go through the toughest time. You gotta be a dad and a mom at the same time. This is just the most amazing and touching thing.

We’re gonna honor and pay tribute to (讚賞；敬意）this wonderful day.
