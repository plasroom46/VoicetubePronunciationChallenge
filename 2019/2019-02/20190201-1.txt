In fact, a group of characteristics known as the Big Five—which are extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness—are regarded as alternative personality descriptors that are actually based on the scientific method.

另外，所謂的五大項性格特質：外向程度、情緒不穩定性、合群程度、盡責性、開放程度，被視為是替代的性向描述，且確實有科學根據。
