You may take them for granted, but your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food over the course of your life, while being strong enough to withstand breakage themselves.

或許你把牙齒視為理所當然，但它們是個奇蹟。在你一生中，它們弄碎你所有的食物，而且自身夠強大，能承受破損。

 * take...for granted [] (phr.) 認為…是理所當然的
 - This is a term that you always hear about people always say I'm never going to take you never going to take that for granted. If you take something for granted it means you don't properly appreciate it cuz you are too familiar with it. I and other words that you don't give something enough attention and love because you're used to it. You think it should be that way. For example, I think a lot of us take our parents love for granted because we're so used to it like from the moment we're born. We get love from our parents and we think that that is just the way it should be right so we take that for granted or we might take our health for granted. But we've had good health for so many years we don't think it's ever going to go away. So these are things that we might not appreciate when we have them but we become aware of them when we lose them so we take them for granted.
