The babies are programmed to look like(寶寶就是設計長這樣）so it have higher chance to survive like human babies had better to look cute or else their parents might feel a little reluctant(不情願的） to look after them when they are screaming like a monster.

In the other cases, the cuteness of animals can help them increase their chances of living under the protection of humans from their predators(免受獵食掠食的動物威脅）. 

They don’t have any realistic value(不需有實際價質） to humans. Just by being cute(只要夠可愛！ ）. They can have a better chance to survive and being well taken care of(被好好照顧）.
