bacteria vs. virus
According to Google: “While both can cause disease, viruses are not living organisms, whereas bacteria are. Viruses are only "active" within host cells which they need to reproduce, while bacteria are single-celled organisms that produce their own energy and can reproduce on their own.” Also, if you’ve heard your doctor talk about antibiotics, these medicines are designed to fight a bacterial infection, not a viral infection.
