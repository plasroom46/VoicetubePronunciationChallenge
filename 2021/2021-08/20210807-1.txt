In fact, one of the most famous fictional universal translators, the Babel fish from  "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", is not a machine at all but a small creature that translates the brain waves and nerve signals of sentient species through a form of telepathy.

事實上，科幻作品裡各個通用翻譯機中最名聞遐邇的一個便是《銀河便車指南》裡的巴別魚。 「牠」壓根不是一部機器，而是一隻微小的生物， 能藉由心電感應來翻譯有意識物種的腦波及神經信號。
