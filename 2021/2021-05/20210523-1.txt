As if constructing the car in LEGO Technic wasn't enough, we also decided we'd like to power it with small LEGO Technic Power Function motors as well. It sounded plausible. On paper.

好像用樂高科技打造車子還不夠，我們也決定要用小樂高動力裝置系列的馬達來驅動這台車。在紙上談兵貌似可信。

Pronunciation:

Constructing - accent on the middle syllable
As well - blended words
Plausible - short o, short i, schwa

1.
* construct [kənˋstrʌkt] (v.) 建造；構築；構成，組成
: to build something or put together different parts to form something whole. 
- I plan to use that wood to construct a little doghouse in the backyard.

2.
* plausible [ˋplɔzəb] (adj.) 貌似真實（或可信）的
: Plausible is something that seems likely to be true, or is believable. 
- He said the bump on his head is from a mosquito bite, which sounds like a plausible explanation.

Plausible vs. possible:

Remember that if something is plausible, it means you’re inclined to believe it. Something that’s possible means that it could happen, even if it’s unlikely. For example, I had a friend named Ralph in college. If he came into school with a headache, it’d be possible that he had come down with some sort of virus, but knowing his character, it’s much more plausible that he simply was out late drinking and partying like usual, and now he’s slightly hung over. Crazy guy, that Ralph.


3.
* on paper [ɑn ˋpepɚ] (phr.) 據書面材料，在書面上，在理論上
相似：in theory
:  judging something by how it has been planned rather than how it really works in practice.
- He had several certifications on his resume so he seemed like a good candidate on paper, but he totally messed up the interview and couldn’t answer even basic technical questions.
