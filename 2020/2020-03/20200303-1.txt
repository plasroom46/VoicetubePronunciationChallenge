Specifically, these are desert locusts, the most destructive type of locusts that eats food and that's terrible news in a region that's food insecure, meaning there are already problems with people getting enough to eat.

尤其，它們是沙漠飛蝗。這是破壞力最高的一種吃作物的蝗蟲，這對這裡的人來說是個壞消息，因為他們本來就缺乏食物了。

Should the coronavirus be considered a pandemic? The WHO hasn’t classified it as a pandemic yet, but it has spread around the world. If you don’t think it is a pandemic, what needs to happen for it to be considered a pandemic?

A：In my opinion, Wuhan coronavirus must be an epidemic. After all, 24 countries have already been impacted. It also influences the economy like tourism, catering, etc. We are not recommended to go to certain countries due to the virus.

P.S. A virus and disease are a bit different.
