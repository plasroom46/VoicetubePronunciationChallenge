You wouldn't be surprised if headphones fell out during exercise, but it's frustrating when it happens while you're sitting still.

運動時耳機掉下來並沒有什麼好稀奇，可讓人受不了的是坐著不動的時候依然會掉。

句子選自此影片：Airpods 耳機掛不住不是耳機的問題！而是你的耳朵？ (Why Do Airpods Fall Out of Your Ear? | Corporis)

1. 有些人的 wouldn't 聽起來比較像 won’t，wou- 應該像中文的「嗚」，嘴巴可以再更噘起來一點，後面的 -dn't 大家發得比較不清楚，可以再更強調一點 d 的音。

2. exercise 念不太順的人，可以把 x 拆成 "ks" 然後分配給前後兩個音節 "ek""ser"cise，先分成三個音節慢慢唸，念熟了再加快速度。

3. frustrating 的-ru- 音有些人會漏掉，或是捲舌的不夠明顯唷！

4. when it happens 的 it 有不少人都在結尾多了 s 的音，這裡動詞是在 happens 所以 s 也只有在 happens 噢！
