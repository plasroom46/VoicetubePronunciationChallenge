These disasters can generally occur at any time of the year but June 1st through November 30th is officially the Atlantic hurricane season.

這些天災基本上在一年中的任何時間都可能發生，但 6 月 1 日到 11 月 30 日為官方的大西洋颶風季。

I think you can say each word. It sounds like you are trying to speak a bit too quickly. Never be afraid to slow down. You can always record a slow and a fast sentence.

I would say, practice the words generally and officially (the long words :).

generally - gen-er-al-ly (stress is on syllable one).
officially -of-fi-ci-al-ly (stress is on syllable two).
