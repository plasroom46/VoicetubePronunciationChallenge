Now we're under the covers. Fast forward to 18. We are more than lovers. Yeah, we are all we need. When we're holding each other. I'm taken back to 2002. Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods on an old Mustang, where we sang. Songs with all our childhood friends. And it went like this, yeah. Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye. Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me. Better hit me, baby, one more time. Paint a picture for you and me. Of the days when we were young. Singing at the top of both our lungs. On the day we fell in love.

現在我們在床被裡 時間快轉到十八歲 我們比情侶更親密 是的，我們只需要彼此 當我們抱緊對方 我就回到了 2002 在森林中央，一台老舊的Mustang，我們在引擎蓋上跳舞 和童年玩伴一起歌唱 那聽起來是這樣 yeah 糟糕，我有九十九個煩惱，唱著 bye bye bye 等等，如果你要和我一起去兜風 Baby 最好再次追求我 為你和我畫一幅畫 記錄我們還年輕的歲月 用盡全力大聲高唱 我們墜入情網的那一天
