Hi guys, welcome to today’s pronunciation challenge and my name is Kristi. 
So it’s a new year and perhaps a lot of people, well, making their new year’s resolution, 
they talked about not procrastinating. So today we have a video from TED and it’s from Tim Urban, 
and he says: Inside the mind of mater procrastinator. So let’s take a look at today’s sentence.
