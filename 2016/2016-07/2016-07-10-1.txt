Hi everybody!Welcome to today's pronunciation challenge, my name is Daniel, and today is sunday, and everything I think is backed to normal after the typhoon, it's quite calm, does a bit of rain, but it's not so windy now. I live in a 加蓋(?), so I was thinking it would be very windy and scary, but it wasn't bad in Taipei, but I hope everyone is okay down south, it was more serious down south, so I hope everyone is okay. Now let's look at today's video, the video I've chosen is TED's Secret to Great Public Speaking, so on pronunciation challenge, we have so many different videos, (well) we have a lot of TED Talks video, and this video is going to give you some advice on how to do a great public speaking video for TED or for anything at all, so if you are going to do any public speaking, this is a really good advice I think, so you can watch the whole video to get some idea, but now let's look at the sentence.
