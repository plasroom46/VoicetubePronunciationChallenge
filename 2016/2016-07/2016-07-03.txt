Thank Daniel.
I think Britain exits EU is a huge influence in European countries. A lot of multinational 
companies could leave in British and set up other headquarters in the EU country. That could influence 
British work opportunities, but this decision, Brexit, couldn't be changed. 
Maybe Brexit has some good advantages, but I don't know.
