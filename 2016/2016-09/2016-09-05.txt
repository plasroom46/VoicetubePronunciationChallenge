This video lets me think the movie, Suicide Squad. The roles, Joker and Harley Quinn may 
be insane. They are through the huge things to let them become insane. 
When you think they destroy the peace, I think everyone wants them to put in prison. 
I guess if someone has an insanity when he know he does that, I think he would choose death. 
Guilt will let his life really bad.
