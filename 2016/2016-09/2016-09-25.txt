Thank Kristi. This video is a good example to interpret the evolution. 
When the animals need to adapt the night, they need to change their eyes' structure.
 Some are that their eyes become bigger to get more light.
 Others are that their eyes can close slowly to get a clear picture. 
The others are their eyes can reflect  the light which can help them get light again.
