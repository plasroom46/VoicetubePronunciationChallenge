Pronunciation tips:

1. I’ve (1) Contractive form of “I have” (2) American: /aɪv/ (Americans use I’ve more than I have) (3) Squish “I” and “have” together, and eliminate the /hv/ sound in /həv/.
2. Asian: (1) Two parts- a-sian /ˈeɪ.ʒən/ (2) How to pronounce /ʒ/ sound? It’s the voiced sound of the sound /ʃ/. Their mouth positions are the same, while you have to let air pass your voice chord when you pronounce /ʒ/. Your lips should be rounded.
3. Cultures (1) Two parts: cul-ture /ˈkʌl.tʃɚ/ (2) /ʌ/ is a very relaxed sound. Only the jaw drops. Lips are relaxed. (3) /ɚ/ is said faster, and in lower pitch, like in “mother.”
4. Opportunity: (1) Four parts: o-ppor-tu-nity /ˌɑː.pɚˈtuː.nə.t̬i/
