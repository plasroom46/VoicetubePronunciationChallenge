Pronunciation tips:

Gluten (I read this word as is, but for Americans, the ‘t’ is almost silent, you can listen to the way it’s read in the video for a better example because it’s hard for me to pronounce it that way)
Wheat (pronounced as ‘weet’)
Barley (two syllables)
Rye (one syllable word, sounds like ‘rai’ )
Extremely (sounds like ex-dream-ly)
