Pronunciation tips:

1.He was: Linking. Weaken the /w/ sound, and it will sound more like /hiɑːz/
2.Stoic: (1) Two parts; sto-ic /ˈstoʊ.ɪk/ (2) Notice the pronunciation of “o” here
3.About it: Linking. Omit the /t/ sound in “about”
4.Importantly: If you look at the dictionary, the pronunciation of the word will be: /ɪmˈpɔːr.tənt.li/, which fully pronounces the two /t/ sound in it, while it is a way that over pronounces the word. To pronounce the word more like a native speaker and sound more natural, you need to know what “stop t” is, which means you have to stop the air. You don’t really have to pronounce the /t/ sound here. Similar examples are: mountain, certain.
