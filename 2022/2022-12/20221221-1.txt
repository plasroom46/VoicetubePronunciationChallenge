Pronunciation tips:

1.Centuries: (1) Original form: century /sɛnʧəri/
2.Killed: (1) The ending sound of the word “kill” is /l/, a voiced sound. (2) So the “d” in “ed” here is pronounced the /d/ sound. /kɪld/
3.10,000: In English, when there is a big number, for example, thousands or millions, the first step is to break the big number into pieces. See the commas between the numbers first, for those commas show you how to break the number up. So just say the numbers before the commas and add “billion,” “million,” “thousand,” etc. afterwards. For example, here is one, zero, comma, zero, zero, zero. So first say the number before the comma, which is “ten.” Then you see the comma, after the comma, there are three digits, so you know it's a thousand.
