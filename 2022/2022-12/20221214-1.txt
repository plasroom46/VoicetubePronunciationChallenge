Pronunciation tips:

1.Practice saying: At the end of the word “practice,” it’s /s/ sound. And the beginning of the next word, which is “saying,” is also /s/ sound. So what we do is just link the two words together and pronounce the /s/ sound once.
2.Asks: It is very hard to pronounce all of the sounds in the word quickly, so native speakers often omit the /k/ ending. But still, it depends on the word that behind “ask” If “ask” is before a consonant sound, then we can omit the /k/ sound, for example, “Ask them to do it.” While if “ask” is before a vowel sound, then we’ll keep the /k/ sound, for example, “Ask if they’ll do it.” In our sentence, “asks” is before the word “you,” so we can omit the /k/ sound.
3.It will: Linking.
4.it will just come out: There is a pause before “come out,” for the speaker uses pause to highlight the main point.
