Pronunciation tips:

1.Fluctuate: Three parts: fluc-tu-ate /ˈflʌk.tʃu.eɪt/
2.Dramatically: (1) Four parts: dra-ma-ti-ca-lly /drəˈmæt̬.ɪ.kəl.i/ (2) Notice the flap t. You don’t have to aspirate the /t/ sound. It’s more like a slight /d/.
3.Certain: /ˈsɝː.tən/. The “t” here is a “stop t,” which means you don’t have to pronounce the actual /t/ sound. What you need to do is to pause a little bit here.
4.Developed: (1) Original form is: develop (2) /p/ is voiceless, so the “d” here sounds more like /t/ instead of /d/
