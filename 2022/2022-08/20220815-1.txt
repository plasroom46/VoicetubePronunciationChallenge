Pronunciation tips:

Our sentence has three sections, the middle section is an example of what’s being said in the first section, therefore try and end with rising tones for the first two sections then the tone can fall down at the end of the third section. Like this: health care (rising tone), treatment (rising tone), suicide rates (falling intonation).
