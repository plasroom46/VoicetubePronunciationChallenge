One of the things I've learned over the years I've been making videos is that people like a combination of familiarity and novelty.

我多年來製作視頻學到的一件事是人們喜歡熟悉與創新的結合。

Pronunciation tips:

1.one of (linking sound)
2.combination (how to pronounce bi)
3.familiarity (6 syllables, pronunciations of the "i"s)
4.novelty (the o and the e)

1.
* novelty [ˋnɑv!tɪ] (n.) 新穎，新奇
: the quality of being new and unusual
- The novelty of the new gadget wore off quickly, and it was soon discarded in favor of something more practical.
對新事物的新鮮感很快便會消逝，人們對其失去興趣，轉而親睞更加實用的東西。
