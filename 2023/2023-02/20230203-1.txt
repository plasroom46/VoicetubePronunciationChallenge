在鳥類和人類中，呼吸系統下半部的形狀有點像是顛倒的彈弓。

Pronunciation tips:

1.Respiratory: /ˈres.pə.rə.tɔːr.i/ (1) Four parts: res-pi-ra-tory (2) The second part “pi” and the third part “ra” sound like are linked together.
2.Shaped: The voiceless sound /p/ impacts the originally voiced sound /d/ from “d.” Because of that, we can pronounce such words more easily. Therefore, the pronunciation of /d/ here is more like /t/, for /p/ is a voiceless sound. Similar examples, danced /dænst/, washed /wɑʃt/, kissed /kɪst/.
3.Sort of: Linking
